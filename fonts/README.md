# Poppins Font Placeholder
# 
# For production, download Poppins font from Google Fonts:
# https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins
# 
# Download these font files and place them in this folder:
# - Poppins-Regular.ttf (weight 400)
# - Poppins-Medium.ttf (weight 500)
# 
# Then update pubspec.yaml fonts section to:
# fonts:
#   - family: Poppins
#     fonts:
#       - asset: fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
#         weight: 400
#       - asset: fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
#         weight: 500
# 
# For now, the app will use the default system font.
